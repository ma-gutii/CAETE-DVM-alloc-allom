Code documentation:

The clean_run function performs the following actions:

    1. Save Current Conditions:
Before starting a new round or experiment, the function saves the current conditions associated with a save_id identifier.
    2. Check Output Directory Existence:
Checks if the output directory associated with the new experiment already exists. If the directory already exists, the code takes measures to avoid overwriting.
    3. Revert Changes in Case of Failure:
If the attempt to create the directory fails due to its preexistence, the code reverts the changes made earlier (restoring self.out_dir to its original value) and raises an exception.
    4. Record Current Conditions:
Adds a pair (save_id, self.outputs.copy()) to the realized_runs list, thus recording the current state of the simulation.
    5. Clear Attributes for the New Round:
Resets relevant attributes for the simulation, such as self.outputs and self.run_counter, preparing for a new simulation round.

This function appears prepare for a new round of simulation, ensuring the integrity of saved data and avoiding accidental overwriting of previous results.
